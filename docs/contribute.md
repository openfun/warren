## Issues

Issues are a valuable way to contribute to Warren. They can include bug reports, feature requests, and general questions or discussions. When creating or interacting with issues, please keep the following in mind:

### 1. Search for existing issues

Before creating a new issue, search the [existing issues](https://github.com/openfun/warren/issues) to see if your concern has already been raised.

Your issue will be reviewed by a project maintainer and you may be offered to open a PR if you want to contribute to the code.
If not, and if your issue is relevant, a contributor will apply the changes to the project.
The issue will then be automatically closed when the PR is merged.

Issues will be closed by project maintainers if they are deemed invalid.
You can always reopen an issue if you believe it hasn't been adequately addressed.

## Releases

The Warren project has multiple services maintained in a single Git repository (_aka_ a monorepo): each service has its own life cycle with its own releases.

We use Git tags to trigger CI builds of the Warren's artifacts (PyPI/NPM packages and Docker images). To make a new release, depending on the service you are releasing, you need to apply the following Git tag pattern conventions:

| Type         | Service      | Git tag pattern                      | Example             |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Back-end     | API (core)   | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-api`          | `v2.0.1-api`        |
|              | API (plugin) | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-api-<plugin>` | `v0.6.22-api-video` |
|              | APP          | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-app`          | `v1.3.6-app`        |
| Front-end    | core         | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-ui`           | `v5.1.0-ui`         |
|              | plugin       | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-ui-<plugin>`  | `v3.22.5-ui-video`  |
| Distribution | \*           | `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`               | `v2.0.0`            |

!!! Note "About Warren distributions"

    A Warren **distribution** is considered as a "meta" package corresponding to a consistent combination of services releases that are known to work well together. This pattern will be used to tag Docker images and the documentation.

### Working on a new release

This project follows FUN's standard process to release a new version. We invite you to read our [handbook](https://handbook.openfun.fr/git#releasing-new-software-version) that describes it into details.

To release back-end python packages or the related Docker images, this process can be applied by-the-book. However, front-end packages use [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage their `CHANGELOG`, version and publication. We will describe how to use it below.

#### Using `changeset` for front-end packages

When working a front-end package, if your changes are worth to be mentioned in the package `CHANGELOG`, we invite you to log them using the `bin/changeset add` command.

When you are ready to release a package, use the `bin/changeset version` command to bump the package version and update the `CHANGELOG` accordingly. The CI will be in charge to publish them afterwards upon `main` branch tagging.
